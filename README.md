# Virtual Clothing Try-On Project

Developed a tool that enables people to virtually try on garments without physically wearing them, providing accurate representations of individuals wearing various clothing items in real-time. Utilized the U-Net deep learning architecture and executed the following key steps:

- **Pre-Processing the Data:** Prepared and cleaned the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.
- **Semantic Segmentation Generation:** Generated precise segmentations of clothing and body parts to distinguish between different regions.
- **Clothes Deformation:** Adapted the clothing items to fit the shape and pose of the person.
- **Geometric Matching:** Aligned the clothing items accurately with the personâ€™s body.
- **Image Warping:** Warped the images to create a natural fit of the clothing on the person.
- **Alias Generator:** Created realistic images by refining the edges and details.
- **Try-On Synthesis:** Synthesized the final images, showcasing the person wearing the virtual clothes convincingly.

This project demonstrated a strong understanding of deep learning techniques and computer vision, contributing to advancements in virtual try-on technology.
